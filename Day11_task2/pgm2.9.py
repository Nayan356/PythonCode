# Read the two parts of the question below: 
# ●	 Write a program such that it asks users to “guess the lucky number”. If the correct number is guessed the program stops, 
# otherwise it continues forever. 

number = int(input("Guess the lucky number "))
while number!= 5:
  print ("That is not the lucky number")
  number = int(input("Guess the lucky number "))
# ●	Modify the program so that it asks users whether they want to guess again each time. Use two variables, ‘number’ for the number and 
# ‘answer’ for the answer to the question whether they want to continue guessing. The program stops if the user guesses the
#  correct number or answers “no”. ( The program continues as long as a user has not answered “no” and has not guessed the correct number)
number = -1
again = "yes"
while number!= 5 and again!= "no":
  number = int(input("Guess the lucky number: "))
  if number!= 5:
    print ("That is not the lucky number")
    again = input("Would you like to guess again? ")
